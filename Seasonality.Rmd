## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
library(readr)
data <- read_csv("Downloads/data-2.csv")
```

```{r}
head(data)
```
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
data$Date <- as.Date(data$Date)
ggplot(data, aes(x = Date, y = Visits)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Web Traffic Over Time",
       x = "Date",
       y = "Number of Visits")
```
```{r}
acf(data$Visits)
```


```{r}
data$Visits_diff <- c(NA, diff(data$Visits))
ggplot(data, aes(x = Date, y = Visits_diff)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Differences in Web Traffic Over Time",
       x = "Date",
       y = "Differences in Visits")
```
```{r}
acf(diff(data$Visits))
```
